# Diplomatic Digital Editions

One of the many benefits of a digital edition is that the readers are not restricted to one way to read the text, as they are with a printed edition. As I have discussed in my [Editorial Practices](editPractices.md), an object like the Tabula Capitolina can be read in a variety of ways, due to its complex layout. Squire makes this point clear when he compares these stones to "make your own adventure" books. In that spirit, below I offer a variety ways which the Tabula can be read. These are by no means the only possibilities, and their position in the list does not correlate to any preference or privilege.
