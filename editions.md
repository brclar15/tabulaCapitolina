# Diplomatic Digital Editions

One of the many benefits of a digital edition is that the readers are not restricted to one way to read the text, as they are with a printed edition. As I have discussed in my [Editorial Practices](editPractices.md), an object like the Tabula Capitolina can be read in a variety of ways, due to its complex layout. Squire makes this point clear when compares these stones "make your own adventure" books. In that spirit, below I offer a few different ways which the Tabula can be read. These are by no means the only ways, and their position in the list does not correlate to any preferance or privilage.
