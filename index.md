## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold the Greek epics, or broken them down into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is on the [Tabula Capitolina](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.2017a:Capitoline_15), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. In order to answer this research question I created a diplomatic digital edition of the texts on the Tabula. As is be discussed in my [editorial practices](editPractices.md), my edition marks these episodic divisions that are not always present on the stone. With these divisions clearly marked-up, I then studied how the textual retelling and the visual retelling found on the stone not only relate to one another, but also to the *Iliad*

Here is a [line drawing](http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/iliaca/images/capitolina1.gif) done by Otto Jahn that has been invaluable to my study of this artifact. There are two such retellings found on the stone: one visual made up of carved figures, and one textual consisting of a prose summary. Since the stone has been partially damaged   

This website is meant to be a convenient way to provide its users with the vast array of information on the Tabulae Iliacae, including scans of plates or drawings of the Tabulae when possible, and extensive photography of the Tabula Capitolina. Once the reader has familiarized themselves with this foundational material, I present my in-depth analysis of the Iliadic retellings based on these episodic divisions. 

I owe a great deal of [thanks](thanks.md) to several people for help with various aspects of this project.

This project will be presented as a DH project to complete my ["Digital Tools for Premodern Studies"](http://ase.tufts.edu/classics/graduate/digitalTools.htm) Masters degree at Tufts University.
