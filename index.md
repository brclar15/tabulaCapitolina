## Aim of the Project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold Greek epics by separating them into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is the [Tabula Capitolina](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.2017a:Capitoline_15), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. In order to answer this research question, I created a diplomatic digital edition of the texts on the Tabula. As is discussed in my [editorial practices](editPractices.md), my edition marks these episodic divisions that are not always present on the stone. With these divisions clearly marked-up, I then studied how the textual retelling and the visual retelling found on the stone not only relate to one another, but also to the *Iliad*.


This website provides its users with a vast array of information on the Tabulae Iliacae, including [scans of plates](tabulae.md) and [drawings](http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/iliaca/images/capitolina1.gif) done by Otto Jahn of the Tabulae when possible, and extensive photography of the Tabula Capitolina. Once the reader has familiarized themselves with this foundational material, I present my in-depth analysis of the Iliadic retellings based on these episodic divisions. 


## Introduction to the Project

The Tabula Capitolina is one artifact out of a group known as the [Tabulae Iliacae](tabulae.md). Following the tradition of recent scholarship done on these objects, I argue that they are highly learned stones that represent a complex connection between carved images and inscribed text. These stones are complex, elite objects that are meant to be worked with by an audience intimately familiar with a wide array of Greek mythology and literature. 

The retellings of the Tabula Capitolina reflect the necessary compression of the genre, but also the specific choices of the artist of the stone. Both the visual and textual retelling largely adhere to the narrative sequence of the *Iliad*, but show freedom to alter small elements that do not change the overall plot. Additionally, both retellings do not include events that take place outside of the Trojan plane, such as the gods in heaven. The gods only appear once in the textual retelling, when Thetis brings the divine armor to her son. In the visual retelling, the artist depicts the gods intervening in the war, but, even here, he has the ability to alter the exact details without changing the final outcome of the poem.

By studying how these retellings are structured, one can gain an insight into the way that an ancient audience would have engaged with these epics as a whole. The episodes that the retellings maintain are deemed essential, and the elements that are elided show the variety of information that can be excluded in a retelling. There are elements that can be varied or omitted, while still making the overall poem recognizable.
