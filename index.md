## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold the Greek epics, or broken them down into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is on the [Tabula Capitolina](http://shot.holycross.edu/eikon/tabulaeiliacae/Capitoline_1.jpg), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. Here is a [line drawing](http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/iliaca/images/capitolina1.gif) done by Otto Jahn that has been invaluable to my study of this artifact. There are two such retellings found on the stone: one visual made up of carved figures, and one textual consisting of a prose summary. Since the stone has been partially damaged   

This website is meant to be a convenient way to provide its users with the full array of background information on the Tabulae Iliacae, scans on plates or drawings of the Tabulae when possible, extensive photography of the Tabula Capitolina, and an in depth analysis of the Iliadic retellings from on it. In order to study this document, I have created a diplomatic digital edition of the text found on the stone. The rationale for this new edition, an explanation of my methods, and the edition itself can all be found [here](digitalEditing.md).

I owe a great deal of [thanks](thanks.md) to several people for help with various aspects of this project.

This project is an ongoing work that will be presented as a DH project to complete my ["Digital Tools for Premodern Studies"](http://ase.tufts.edu/classics/graduate/digitalTools.htm) Masters degree at Tufts University.
