# Conclusion

##General Trends of the Retellings on the Tabula Capitolina

The Tabula Capitolina, is a complex document that combines an array of images and texts related to the Epic Cycle. Its retellings of the *Iliad* on the stone offer a compelling case study as to how an ancient audience would have retold these epics in a shorter form. While these retellings are independent of one another, they shed light into how this genre of retellings works across different media.

The textual retelling is a continuous prose narrative without book divisions. It almost entirely excludes the actions of the gods, and rejects events that do not take place on the Trojan plain. It shows a tendency to omit action that takes place on the battlefield except when it involved principal characters and their deaths. Its narrative sequence largely follows that of the *Iliad*, but does alter the position of small elements, such as the retrieval of Patroclus' body.

At times, the textual retelling is highly specific, which reveals certain essential elements of a retelling of the *Iliad*. Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax are all named in the embassy to Achilles, Dolon and Rhesus are killed during the night raid, and the Greek chiefs, all of whom are named, are injured and removed from the battlefield. In a highly compressed retelling such as this, the inclusion of these details shows their importance to the epic. They cannot be compressed out to save space, but rather are meaningful aspects that help make these episodes recognizable to an ancient audience. 

The visual retelling is divided into Iliadic books, and is often accompanied with labels to identify various figures. 

- not meant to mirror the literature
- certain figures stand for wider forces
- does not show the gods in heaven
- shows only what precipitates action
- MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE ARMS ARE MADE ELSEWHERE, BUT INCLUDED
