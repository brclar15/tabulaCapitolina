## General Trends of the Retellings on the Tabula Capitolina

The Tabula Capitolina is a complex document that combines an array of images and texts related to the Epic Cycle. Its retellings of the *Iliad* offer a compelling case study as to how an ancient audience would have retold these epics in a shorter form. While these retellings are independent of one another, they shed light on the way that this genre of retellings works across different media.

The textual retelling is a continuous narrative without book divisions. It almost entirely excludes the actions of the gods, and rejects events that do not take place on the Trojan plain. It shows a tendency to omit action that takes place on the battlefield except when it involved principal characters and their deaths. Its narrative sequence largely follows that of the *Iliad*, but does alter the position of small elements, such as the retrieval of Patroclus' body.

At times, the textual retelling is highly specific, which reveals certain essential elements of a retelling of the *Iliad*. Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax are all named in the embassy to Achilles, Dolon and Rhesus are killed during the night raid, and the Greek chiefs, all of whom are named, are injured and removed from the battlefield at a specific moment. In a highly compressed retelling such as this, the inclusion of these details shows their importance to the epic. They cannot be compressed out to save space, but rather are meaningful aspects that help make these episodes recognizable to an ancient audience. 

The visual retelling is divided into Iliadic books, and is often accompanied by labels that identify various figures. Given the nature of its medium, it cannot go beyond the set space that it reserved for each book, nor can it leave a portion of its allotted space blank. Where the textual retelling briefly relates the action of the battle books, the visual retelling shows warriors fighting, even if they are not always principal actors in the larger scope of the war. The artist of these carvings uses certain figures (both gods and men) on both sides of the war to stand for the larger forces behind them. While the stone can only dedicate enough space to show Achilles slaying one Trojan in the Scamander, this scene is meant to call to mind the other Trojans whom he slaughters during this point of the narrative. Similarly, showing one god, such as Poseidon in book 20, calls to mind the actions of all of the gods in that book, not just the deeds of that specific deity. 

The carved images also demonstrate the way that certain elements can be added or altered without disrupting the plot. The inclusion of Diomedes when Patroclus dons Achilles' amor or Hermes' appearance within the tent Achilles at the end of the poem should not be seen as errors of inconsistency, but rather as the freedom given to the creator of the retelling. Altering these elements within a given episode does not change the outcome of the story, nor does it make it recognizable to an ancient audience. These variations are legitimate alternate traditions that have largely been lost to a modern audience. The Tabulae Iliacae are not meant be exact copies of the Homeric texts, but rather serve to evoke the stories for an audience that is already intimately familiar with the larger work. 

My work on the Tabula Capitolina was enhanced by my creating of a digital diplomatic edition, and, due to this format, is a meaningful contribution to the history of scholarship on this object. A digital diplomatic edition faithfully represents every intentional mark on the stone and connects my edition to images of the artifact. This connection allows the reader to interact more closely with the object itself when compared to reading a printed edition of the texts on the stone. Creating similar editions for the remaining Tabulae Iliacae will further the study on these objects as a group. Comparisons among the various stones will be more possible and likely more fruitful once these other stones have been studied in the way that I have approached the Tabula Capitolina. These complex documents are best represented in a digital context, in order that the reader can fully gasp the relationships between the images and texts on the stone. 

Studying the Tabula Capitolina has helped reveal how an ancient audience would have retold the *Iliad* by dividing the poem into smaller episodes. By studying these retellings, one gains insight into the episodes that are essential to make the poem recognizable, as well as the elements that are able to be altered without changing the overall structure of the poem. Retellings serve to shed light into the way that an ancient reader would have interacted with these larger epics, and what images or words were able to call to mind the complete version of each episode.
