# The Tabula Capitolina in Context


The scholarship on the Tabulae Iliacae has been divided on the subject of their importance. Previously, they were thought to be low class carvings for adult education due to some inconsistencies between the stone and the Iliad. However, more recent scholars have shown that these highly complex and allusive documents are greatly worthy of interest. The wealth of images and text that they provide, particularly the Tabula Capitolina, make them excellent sources for the comparison of retellings. 

The drawing of this tabula done by Jahn was also invaluable to the study of this document.
