# Timelines of the Retellings on the Tabula Capitolina

- [Timeline of the visual retelling on the stone](tabImagesTL.md)
  - the pictorial bands of books 1, and 13 through 24 of the *Iliad*

- [Timeline of the textual retelling on the stone](tabTextTL.md)
  - the prose summary of books 7 through 24 of the *Iliad* inscribed on the stele

These timelines serve to show the division of episodes in both of the Iliadic retellings found on the Tabula. They provide an "at a glance" view so that the reader can consult them after they have read through the [analysis section](analysis.md). In order to make sense of the labels and descriptions, I recommend that the reader read the analysis page first, and then consult the timelines if they want a quicker view of how each retelling lays out its action. 

Where the pictorial retelling has multiple episodes per book, this reflects the mark-up of my XML edition, where each episode within a book in the visual retellings is in a separate `ab` tag. 

I have chosen the titles and descriptions myself; they are not preserved on the stone. They are meant to reflect the action that is shown in the retellings, and convey its contents to a modern audience.
