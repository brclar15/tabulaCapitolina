## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold the *Iliad*, or broken it down into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is on the [Tabula Capitolina](http://shot.holycross.edu/eikon/tabulaeiliacae/Capitoline_1.jpg), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. Here is a [line drawing](http://www.mediterranees.net/art_antique/oeuvres/iliaca/images/capitolina1.gif) done by Otto Jahn that has been invaluable to my study of this object. There are two such retellings found on the stone: one visual in carved figures, and one textual in a prose summary. Since the stone has been partially damaged (see [Introduction](intro.md)), I was unable to analyze the way that the entire *Iliad* is retold, but rather only the sections that survive on the stone. I have compared the two different retellings on the Tabula Capitolina to the text of the [*Iliad*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0134).  

In order to study this document, I have created a [diplomatic digital edition](digitalEditing.md) of the text found on the stone. 

I owe a great deal of [thanks](thanks.md) to several people for help with various aspects of this project.

This project is an ongoing work that will be presented as a DH project to complete my ["Digital Tools for Premodern Studies"](http://ase.tufts.edu/classics/graduate/digitalTools.htm) Masters degree at Tufts University. Here are some ideas of how I plan to [expand this project](continueWork.md). 

Here is a [preliminary bibliography](bibliography.md)
