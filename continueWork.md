# Moving Forward

## Ideas on how to expand this project

### Presentation
- figure out how to link edition .html file directly
- organize website with home button and side bar for better navigation 
- insert text passage and image ref for each book in the commentary section, *if possible*
- add images into the various text pages to glam it up

### Content 
- add in comparison to [Apollodorus' Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D4), **essential**
- do more sophisticated transforms on the editon
  - generate various editions (with all editorial additions, just what's on the stone, etc)
- dig deeper into retellings of the "battle books"
  - analyze significance of figures shown on the stone for those books
- dig deeper into the inclination towards Poseidon
- add image citations for visual retellings
- add rough line ranges for Iliad passages
  - Calculate relative sizes within work and within book, *maybe*?
- Plokamos social links between figures on stone, *maybe*? 
- a more elaborate discussion//introduction on the Tabula Capitolina, referencing bibliography, **essential**
  
### Broader Expansion   
- Look for and analyze other Iliadic retellings
  - metrical summaries in VA
- Add Epic Cycle portion of the Tabula Capitolina to this site, *maybe*?
