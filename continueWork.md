# Moving Forward

## Ideas on how to expand this project

### Presentation
- figure out how to link edition .html file directly
- organize website with home links 
- create page with links to all of the linked images (jahn's and plates)
- expand the Tabulae CSV file with more detailed information??
- undo unnecessary link [here](https://brclar15.github.io/tabulaCapitolina/analysisPage.html)
  - **OR** Do general trends thing
- see if I can get the imagecitation2 tool to work and put them above
- link editorial practices from the home page start section
- add back feature to the home thing where needed


### Content 
- add in comparison to [Apollodorus' Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D4), **essential**
- do more sophisticated transforms on the editon
  - generate various editions (with all editorial additions, just what's on the stone, etc)
- dig deeper into retellings of the "battle books"
  - analyze significance of figures shown on the stone for those books
- dig deeper into the inclination towards Poseidon
- add rough line ranges for Iliad passages
- make sure im solid on the Timelines 
  - compare that other guys?
- Go over editorial practices more

  
### Broader Expansion   
- Add Epic Cycle portion of the Tabula Capitolina to this site, *maybe*?
