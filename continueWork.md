## Ideas on how to expand this project

### Presentation
- figure out how to link edition .html file directly
- create page with links to all of the linked images (jahn's and plates)
- expand the Tabulae CSV file with more detailed information??
- undo unnecessary link [here](https://brclar15.github.io/tabulaCapitolina/analysisPage.html)
  - **OR** Do general trends thing
- put in ICT2 links everywhere


### Content 
- do more sophisticated transforms on the editon
  - generate various editions (with all editorial additions, just what's on the stone, etc)
- add rough line ranges for Iliad passages
- make sure im solid on the Timelines 
  - compare that other guy's?
